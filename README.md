# ToPlayTicTacToe
Here's my attempt to create a tic tac toe game on python. Is it difficult? Not really? Did it take me forever? Yes.

This was a milestone project in the Udemy Zero to Hero Python course. 

It was quite an acheivement because I'm not good at this but it seems to work!

This is a Jupyter notebook so if you do not have anaconda, you may not be able to read it. I've also uploaded it as a python file.
